Originally designed for [Multistack, LLC](http://multistack.com/). for use with
[Epicor ERP 10](https://www.epicor.com/en-us/erp-systems/epicor-erp/), this software package allows intuitive and easy
access to business data with fewer clicks.  The project was brought about due to concerns about searching between so
many windows for basic information.  EasyButton provides an intuitive web panel to aggregate all the data you need in
one succinct view.

This is the open source branch for EasyButton, published under the
[MIT permissive open-source license](https://github.com/zgoethel/eb3/blob/master/LICENSE).  The source is open for
usage, modification, and analysis.  Please
[contact](mailto:zach.goethel+github@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20EasyButton%203%20Inquiry) for usage and
support in a production environment.

## Data aggregation

The greatest offering of EasyButton is its ability to gather data.  Several sources of data can be searched and stitched
together, presenting data to the user in one accessible and succinct format.  EasyButton can search for a part's pricing
and inventory data, then match it up to ordering data.  By analyzing multiple sources of data, EasyButton can give a
better insight into how orders are progressing and what part stocks require attention.

Aggregation is performed by flexible configuration which specifies what fields are relevant, where EasyButton should
find them, and how they should be presented to the end-user.  Everything from there is up to you; use EasyButton to
drive business knowing that _your_ business data is at the wheel.

_**Figure:** EasyButton combines multiple sources of data into intuitive and useful forms._

## Easy access

Accessibility to data is key.  An intuitive interface is a must.

EasyButton was created with a simple goal in mind: _fewer clicks_.  I had barely spent a week with our Enterprise
Resource Planning software before I was taken aback by the number of clicks to access basic data.  Price lists were four
mouse clicks and a search away from part data.  Inventory data was in an entirely separate window.  Trying to teach
this system to an incoming employee was a nightmare.  Where is lead time?  Where is the unit price?  Where do we keep
these parts in the warehouse?

Thus came about EasyButton, created to keep everything close together.  No data should be more than a couple of clicks
away.  One screen should combine basic useful data without having to search through several windows.

## Custom reports

Easily find and export useful data into PDFs, Excel sheets, or CSV.  Search for what you need and export it as a
portable spreadsheet.  Report generation in EasyButton allows collection of several fields as the user requires and an
ability to create sharable data for your business:

 * Find parts related to a certain job.
 * Find what parts are low in stock for a certain vendor.
 * Find and share potential issues before they get in the way.
 * Provide insight into order history.
 * **Virtually any report can be generated.**
