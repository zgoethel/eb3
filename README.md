Data aggregation web panel for Enterprise Resource Planning

Originally designed for Multistack, LLC. for use with Epicor ERP 10, this software package allows intuitive and easy
access to business data with fewer clicks.  The project was brought about due to concerns about searching between so
many windows for basic information.  EasyButton provides an intuitive web panel to aggregate all the data you need in
one succinct view.
